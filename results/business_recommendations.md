## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### **Recommendation 1: Implement Positive Review Collection Campaign**

‚Ä¢ Avoid prompting during frustrating moments (app crashes, errors)
‚Ä¢ Implement 7-day cooldown between prompts per user

Message Optimization:
‚Ä¢ A/B test different prompt messages
‚Ä¢ Personalize based on user behavior patterns
‚Ä¢ Include specific achievements or milestones
```

**Phase 2: Targeted User Segmentation (Weeks 5-8)**
```
High-Value Users:
‚Ä¢ Users with >10 app sessions

Specific Prompts by User Journey:
‚Ä¢ New Users: "How was your first week with [App Name]?"
‚Ä¢ Power Users: "What's your favorite feature and why?"
‚Ä¢ Premium Users: "How has [Premium Feature] improved your experience?"
```

**Progressive Review Collection**
```
Step 1: Quick rating (1-5 stars)
Step 2: "Help others by sharing more details" (optional)
Step 3: Specific feature feedback prompts
Step 4: Thank you + small reward for detailed feedback
```

**Content Guidance**
```
Provide Review Templates:
‚Ä¢ "I love this app because..."
‚Ä¢ "The [specific feature] helps me..."
‚Ä¢ "Compared to other apps, this one..."
‚Ä¢ "I would recommend this app to..."
```

#### **Success Metrics**

‚Ä¢ Support ticket submission
‚Ä¢ Low engagement scores

Intervention Triggers:
‚Ä¢ Immediate: Technical issue resolution

```

**Negative Review Response Protocol**
```
Response Timeline:
‚Ä¢ <24 hours: Acknowledge and apologize
‚Ä¢ <48 hours: Provide solution or workaround
‚Ä¢ <72 hours: Follow up with resolution confirmation
‚Ä¢ 1 week: Request updated review if issue resolved

Response Template:
"Hi [Name], thank you for your feedback. We've identified the issue you mentioned and have implemented a fix in version X.X. Please try updating your app and let us know if this resolves your concern. We'd appreciate the opportunity to earn a better rating once you've experienced the improvements."
