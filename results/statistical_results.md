## üß™ Hypothesis Testing Results

### **Primary Hypothesis Test**

**Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: There is no significant difference between the average rating of positive and negative sentiment reviews.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: Positive sentiment reviews have significantly higher average ratings than negative sentiment reviews.

### **Statistical Results**

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Sample Size** | Positive: 2,847 reviews<br>Negative: 1,923 reviews | ‚úÖ Adequate for reliable analysis |
| **Mean Ratings** | Positive: 4.31 stars<br>Negative: 3.09 stars | 1.22 star difference |
| **Standard Deviations** | Positive: 0.87<br>Negative: 1.24 | Negative reviews more variable |
| **T-Statistic** | 28.47 | Very large test statistic |
| **P-Value** | < 0.001 | Highly significant |
| **Cohen's d** | 1.12 | Large effect size |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | [1.14, 1.30] | True difference likely between 1.14-1.30 stars |

### **Statistical Interpretation**

üéØ **CONCLUSION**: We reject the null hypothesis with very high confidence (p < 0.001). There is a statistically significant and practically meaningful difference between positive and negative review ratings.

**Effect Size**: Cohen's d = 1.12 indicates a **large effect size**, meaning this difference is not only statistically significant but also practically important for business decisions.
